# Comprehensive Psychological Analysis System (CPAS)

A production-ready psychological analysis system that provides comprehensive behavioral analysis and personality insights.

## Features

- Multimodal data analysis (text, audio, video)
- Advanced personality profiling
- Cognitive analysis
- Relationship dynamics analysis
- Cultural adaptation
- Clinical validation
- Real-time system upgrades

## Production Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+
- At least 8GB RAM
- NVIDIA GPU (recommended for optimal performance)

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/cpas.git
cd cpas
```

2. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

3. Build and start the services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The application will be available at:
- API: http://localhost:8000
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Grafana Dashboard: http://localhost:3000
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090

### Production Deployment

For production deployment, follow these steps:

1. Configure your environment:
   - Set appropriate environment variables in `.env`
   - Configure SSL certificates
   - Set up a proper database (if needed)

2. Build the production image:
```bash
docker build -t cpas:latest .
```

3. Deploy using your preferred orchestration tool (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, etc.)

### Monitoring and Logging

The system includes:
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Structured logging to `logs/app.log`

### Security Considerations

- All API endpoints are protected with JWT authentication
- Rate limiting is enabled by default
- Input validation and sanitization
- Regular security updates

### Scaling

The application is designed to scale horizontally. Adjust the number of workers in the Dockerfile based on your needs.

### Backup and Recovery

- Regular database backups (if using a database)
- Model versioning and rollback capabilities
- Log rotation and archival

## Development

### Local Development

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

### Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest
```
