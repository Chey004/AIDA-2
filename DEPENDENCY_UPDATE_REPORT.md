# AIDA-2 Dependency Update Report

## Summary

This report summarizes the findings from attempting to update all dependencies in the AIDA-2 project to their latest versions. The update process revealed several compatibility issues, particularly between Python 3.12, FastAPI, and Pydantic.

## Current Status

- **Core ML Dependencies**: Successfully updated and working (PyTorch, Transformers, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- **Web Framework**: Compatibility issues between FastAPI 0.95.2 and Pydantic 1.10.13 in Python 3.12
- **Other Dependencies**: Successfully updated (sentry-sdk, spacy, librosa, etc.)

## Compatibility Issues

1. **FastAPI and Pydantic**: The current version of FastAPI (0.95.2) has compatibility issues with Python 3.12 and Pydantic 1.10.13, resulting in the error:
   ```
   TypeError: ForwardRef._evaluate() missing 1 required keyword-only argument: 'recursive_guard'
   ```

2. **NumPy Compatibility**: NumPy 2.x is not compatible with several libraries that expect NumPy 1.x. We've downgraded to NumPy 1.26.3 for better compatibility.

## Successful Updates

The following dependencies were successfully updated and tested:

- PyTorch: 2.2.0
- Transformers: 4.36.2
- NumPy: 1.26.3
- scikit-learn: 1.4.0
- sentry-sdk: 2.32.0

## Recommendations

1. **Python Version**: Consider using Python 3.10 or 3.11 instead of 3.12 for better compatibility with FastAPI and Pydantic.

2. **FastAPI and Pydantic Versions**: Use one of these combinations:
   - FastAPI 0.95.2 with Pydantic 1.10.13 on Python 3.10/3.11
   - FastAPI 0.104.1 with Pydantic 2.4.2 on Python 3.10/3.11

3. **Dependency Management**: Consider using a tool like Poetry or Conda for better dependency management and environment isolation.

4. **Testing Strategy**: Implement comprehensive tests to verify compatibility when updating dependencies.

## Next Steps

1. Create a virtual environment with Python 3.10 or 3.11
2. Install the recommended dependency versions
3. Test the application thoroughly
4. Update the requirements.txt file with the verified compatible versions

## Minimal Working Example

A minimal working example (`minimal_app.py`) has been created to demonstrate the core ML functionality without the FastAPI components. This script successfully loads and runs a transformer model, showing that the core ML dependencies are working correctly.

## Unused Dependencies

The following dependencies appear to be unused in the current codebase and could potentially be removed:

- dash (no dashboard components found in the code)
- plotly (used only if dash is needed)
- arxiv and scholarly (no academic paper processing found in the code)

## Conclusion

The core ML functionality of AIDA-2 can work with updated dependencies, but the FastAPI web framework has compatibility issues with Python 3.12. Downgrading Python or carefully selecting compatible versions of FastAPI and Pydantic is recommended for a fully functional application.
